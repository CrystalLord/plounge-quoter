This is a little test project to hopefully improve my Kotlin abilities.
Plounge-Quoter is a program which should read in given text, and then overlay
that text on an image. It should also have the ability to submit the quote
directly to the official [Plounge Quotes tumblr](http://ploungequotes.tumblr.com) in such a way that formats the
post to the standard.
